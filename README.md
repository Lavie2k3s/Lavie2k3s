# Who is Lavie2k3s?

## For the blind, he is vision. 
## For the hungry, he is the chef. 
## For the thirsty, he is water. 
## If Lavie2k3s thinks, I agree. 
## If Lavie2k3s speaks, I'm listening. 
## If Lavie2k3s has a million fans, I am one of them. 
## If Lavie2k3s has ten fans, I am one of them.
## If Lavie2k3s has only one fan, that is me. 
## If Lavie2k3s has no fans, I no longer exist. 
## If the whole world is against Lavie2k3s, I am against the whole world.
# I will love Lavie2k3s until my very last breath.
